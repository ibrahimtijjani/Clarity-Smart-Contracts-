# **App Name**: StacksLiquid

## Core Features:

- Token Balance Display: Display STX and SIP-010 token balances for the user's wallet.
- Token Deposit: Deposit STX or SIP-010 tokens into specified liquidity pools via user interface connected to the wallet.
- Token Withdrawal: Withdraw STX or SIP-010 tokens from specified liquidity pools via user interface connected to the wallet.
- Rewards Display: Display rewards earned for providing liquidity in an easy to read format.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to reflect the innovative nature of DeFi.
- Secondary color: Implement a clean, light grey (#F5F5F5) for backgrounds to ensure readability.
- Accent: Use green (#2ecc71) to highlight successful transactions and available rewards.
- Use a clear and intuitive layout with well-defined sections for each function (deposit, withdraw, rewards).
- Incorporate relevant icons for tokens, pools, and actions to improve user comprehension.

## Original User Request:
create a decentralized finance (DeFi) application on the Stacks blockchain that allows users to deposit liquidity into a protocol. This will include Clarity smart contracts, Clarinet tests, and a UI to interact with the contracts.

## Project Overview
We'll build a liquidity pool protocol where users can:

- Deposit STX or SIP-010 tokens into liquidity pools
- Earn rewards for providing liquidity
- Withdraw their liquidity plus rewards
