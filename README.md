# StacksLiquid

StacksLiquid is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application built on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to deposit STX and SIP-010 tokens into liquidity pools, earn rewards for providing liquidity, and withdraw their liquidity plus rewards. The application includes Clarity smart contracts for secure and transparent operations and a Next.js UI for user interaction.
